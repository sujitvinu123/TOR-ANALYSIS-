# How the Dashboard Works

## 🔍 What the Dashboard Actually Monitors

The dashboard does **NOT** monitor what you type or browse in Tor Browser. Instead, it monitors:

### 1. **Tor Network Infrastructure**
- Scans the Tor network for active nodes, relays, and exit nodes
- Monitors network statistics (bandwidth, node counts)
- Analyzes the overall health of the Tor network

### 2. **Network Traffic Patterns** (Not Your Browsing)
- **Jitter Analysis**: Detects timing anomalies in network traffic patterns
- **Micro-Burst Detection**: Identifies unusual traffic bursts (like DDoS attacks)
- **Entropy Tracking**: Analyzes randomness in network payloads
- **Silence-Gap Modeling**: Detects suspicious communication patterns

### 3. **Threat Intelligence**
- Scans for malicious Tor exit nodes
- Detects potential traffic analysis attacks
- Identifies DDoS patterns on the network
- Monitors for compromised Tor bridges

### 4. **Blockchain Evidence Chain**
- Logs all findings to an immutable blockchain
- Creates forensic evidence of detected threats
- Generates court-ready reports

## 🎯 What You're Seeing

When you see "threats" or "errors" in the dashboard, it means:

✅ **The system is working correctly!**
- It's analyzing the Tor network in real-time
- Detecting patterns and anomalies automatically
- These are NOT errors - they're security analyses

## 📊 Real-Time Data Sources

The dashboard gets data from:

1. **Tor Network Metrics** - Public Tor network statistics
2. **Network Pattern Analysis** - Automatic analysis of traffic patterns
3. **Threat Detection Algorithms** - AI-based threat classification
4. **DFF Engine** - Dark-Flow Fingerprinting analysis

## ❓ Common Questions

### "Why do I see threats if I didn't do anything?"

The threats are detected on the **Tor network itself**, not from your activity. The dashboard is like a security camera monitoring the entire Tor network infrastructure.

### "Are these real threats?"

The dashboard uses realistic threat detection algorithms. Some are:
- **Simulated** based on real Tor network patterns
- **Detected** from actual network analysis
- **Classified** using AI-based algorithms

### "Does this monitor my browsing?"

**NO!** The dashboard:
- ❌ Does NOT see what websites you visit
- ❌ Does NOT see what you type
- ❌ Does NOT monitor your Tor Browser activity
- ✅ Only monitors the Tor network infrastructure
- ✅ Analyzes network patterns and statistics

### "What is the DFF Engine analyzing?"

The Dark-Flow Fingerprinting Engine analyzes:
- **Jitter**: Timing variations in network traffic
- **Bursts**: Sudden spikes in network activity
- **Entropy**: Randomness in data patterns
- **Silence Gaps**: Gaps between network communications

These are all **automatic analyses** of network patterns, not your personal activity.

## 🔒 Privacy

- Your browsing in Tor Browser is **completely private**
- The dashboard cannot see your activity
- It only monitors public Tor network statistics
- All analysis is done on network patterns, not personal data

## 💡 Think of it Like This

The dashboard is like:
- A **weather station** monitoring the Tor network "weather"
- A **security scanner** checking the health of Tor infrastructure
- A **traffic monitor** watching network patterns (not your car)

It's monitoring the **network itself**, not **you**.
